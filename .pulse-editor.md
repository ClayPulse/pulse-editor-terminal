# About Pulse App
This is a Pulse App template. A Pulse App is a module federated app that can run standalone or be integrated as an extension to Pulse Editor platform.

Pulse Editor is a modular, cross-platform, AI-powered productivity platform with federated app collaboration and extensible workflows. Pulse Editor itself does not serve any key features except providing a place for Pulse Apps to be hosted and interacted. Pulse apps are loaded to Pulse Editor via Module Federation.

# About Pulse App React template
You are now using the official React template for Pulse Apps. It consists both frontend and backend codes. 

## Frontend code
The frontend uses React, and frontend code is located under `src/`, except in `src/assets` (public folder) and `src/server-function` (backend folder). This template is not much different from a standard React app, except that there is a pre-made entry at `src/main.tsx`. It does not yet support multi-page app, so there is only one entry point. 

In addition, the template comes with `@pulse-editor/react-api` pre-installed -- a npm package to interact with Pulse Editor platform in case of:
- read editor context
- interact with other Pulse Apps

## Backend code
The backend uses Node.js, and backend code is located under `src/server-function`. If the frontend needs to call backend API endpoint, it can use fetch to do so. For example, to call an echo endpoint, use `fetch("/server-function/echo")`.
